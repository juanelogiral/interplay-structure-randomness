## README ##

This project contains the code necessary to reproduce Figures 4,5,6 of the pre-print "Interplay of structured and random interactions in many-species ecological dynamics".

To build a figure, just call the Python script without additional arguments, e.g. python fig4.py.

The folder ecosim contains the functions and classes necessary to simulate Lotka-Volterra dynamics. This code is assembled as a light version of the library "ecosim" by Emil Mallmin.

#### FILES ####

fig4.py : Builds figure 4.

fig5.py : Builds figure 5.

fig6.py : Builds figure 6.

fig6_files.pkl : Contains the matrices and initial conditions for the simulation underpinning figure 6.
